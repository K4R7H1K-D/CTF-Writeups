Python snippet to decrypt this:

```python
x = "BKIAYQ^CXONuELuREXYW"
key = 0x2a
f = ''.join([chr(ord(c) ^ key) for c in x])
print(f)

```

**Walkthrough of Decryption**

1. **First 8 Characters**:
    - `_hacks_{` is directly taken as it is.
2. **Decrypting Modified Middle Characters** (`w1{1wq8]8lle<`):
    - Apply the reverse logic based on even/odd indices:
        - Even â†’ Subtract 5.
        - Odd â†’ Add 2.
    - Process each character accordingly.
3. **Last Character** (`T`):
    - Add it directly to the decrypted flag.
4. **Combine Everything**:
    - Result is the fully reconstructed flag.

```python
def decrypt_flag(encrypted_text):
    # Extract parts of the encrypted text
    first_part = encrypted_text[:8]  # First 8 characters (unchanged)
    modified_part = encrypted_text[8:23]  # Middle part to decrypt
    last_character = encrypted_text[-1]  # Include 'T'

    # Start building the decrypted flag
    decrypted_flag = first_part

    # Decrypt the modified middle part
    for i, char in enumerate(modified_part):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index in modified part -> 5 was added
            decrypted_flag += chr(ord(char) - 5)
        else:           # Odd index in modified part -> 2 was subtracted
            decrypted_flag += chr(ord(char) + 2)

    # Append the last character (T)
    decrypted_flag += last_character

    return decrypted_flag

# Encrypted text in flag.txt
encrypted_text = "_hacks_{w1{1wq8]8lle<,T}"
decrypted_flag = decrypt_flag(encrypted_text)
print("Decrypted Flag:", decrypted_flag)

```
